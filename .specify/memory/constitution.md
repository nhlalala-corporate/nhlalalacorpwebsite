# Nhlalala Corporate Website Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Professional Excellence
All development must maintain the highest standards of quality that reflect Nhlalala Corporate's position as a premier technology services provider operating in Africa. Code, design, and functionality must consistently represent excellence to clients and stakeholders.

### II. User-Centric Design
Every feature and design decision prioritizes user experience and accessibility. All implementations must follow WCAG guidelines and ensure the website serves diverse user needs effectively across different devices, browsers, and accessibility requirements.

### III. Performance-First Architecture
Performance is non-negotiable: all pages must load in under 3 seconds. Every addition to the codebase must be evaluated for its impact on performance metrics including Time to Interactive (TTI) and Core Web Vitals.

### IV. Semantic HTML and Accessibility
All markup must be semantically correct and accessible. Every component must include proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility to ensure inclusive access to information.

### V. Responsive and Cross-Browser Compatibility
All implementations must function flawlessly across all major browsers and device sizes. Responsive design is mandatory, with mobile-first approach as the foundation for all new features.

## Technical Constraints

### Technology Stack Adherence
All development must be compatible with Nuxt.js 4.x architecture. Use Tailwind CSS for styling following the established design system with primary colors (#2f93ff, #0f70f5). Maintain dark/light mode functionality using @nuxtjs/color-mode.

### SEO and Discoverability
All pages must maintain proper SEO implementation including meta tags, schema markup, sitemaps, and structured data. Every new feature must preserve or enhance search engine visibility and accessibility.

### Content Management
All business information including contact details, service descriptions, and company information must remain accurate and up-to-date. Changes to core business data require explicit approval before implementation.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
All code must follow consistent formatting and naming conventions with meaningful variable and function names. Components should have single responsibilities and be modular. All code changes must preserve existing functionality and include appropriate automated tests.

### Review and Validation Process
All changes must pass build process before merging. Cross-browser compatibility testing is required for major browsers. Performance testing must verify benchmarks before production deployment. Dark/light mode functionality must be tested with each change.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices for the Nhlalala Corporate website. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require explicit documentation of business justification and impact assessment. All team members are responsible for identifying and reporting potential violations of these principles.
